**Male and female graduate enrollment (1967 - 2015)** 

Compare trends in total graduate enrollment for males and females (including full-time/part-time and private/public universities) in the United States from 1967 - 2015.

Describe your results statistically, graphically and in text.

```{r}
#Chi Square: Comparing porportion of males enrolled compared to females

#Question: Is there a significant association between sex and total graduate enrollment in the U.S. from 1967 - 2015? 

#Create an appropriate df: when running chi-square, we want data frame that only contains counts

get_guns <- gc_df %>% 
  filter(gender != "NA", make_get_guns != "NA") %>% 
  count(gender, make_get_guns) %>% 
  spread(make_get_guns, n) %>% 
  select(-gender)


rownames(get_guns) <- c("Female", "Male") # reassign row names from 1, 2 to be more informative Female and Male

#Look at the actual proportions:

guns_prop <- prop.table(as.matrix(get_guns), 1)
guns_prop 

#,1 = proportion calculated by row 

# Run chi-square test for independence (sig association between sex of respondents and enrollment in graduate school?)

guns_x2 <- chisq.test(get_guns)
guns_x2
